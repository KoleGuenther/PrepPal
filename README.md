# PrepPal
Preppal is a web application designed to help people with meal prep, currently its focus is to have a majority of meals made with limited appliances. Visitors are able to view all recipes on the site, learn about PrepPal, and get the option to create an account. Once creating an account, Users can create recipes for others to see, adding more information about it. Users can save recipes as well, and “My Recipes” was made so you can see all recipes you have created, and also the ones they have saved. There are also Featured Recipes (some other recipes I picked) to display more about and put on a pedestal.
Some key features include the ability to create, view, edit, and delete recipes, as well as being able to save them (Only for authenticated users). I also added tags for later filtering, such as “quick meal”, “vegetarian”, or “limited appliances”. They all include short descriptions that fill “All Recipes”, “My Recipes”, and “Featured Recipes” (if they become featured, which is easily done in the admin panel, just selecting which recipe you would like to become featured).
